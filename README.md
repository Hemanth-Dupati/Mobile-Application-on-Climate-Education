# Mobile-Application-on-Climate-Education
In this project, we built a mobile app with react native. We designed it in the basic form of a game, with a user-friendly platform. 

This project aims to address the lack of broad support and intervention for climate change remedies by leveraging gamification features and customized learning pathways to engage users in an interactive gaming platform. The platform provides scenarios, challenges, and quizzes to educate users about climate change while also entertaining them. By increasing knowledge and comprehension of climate change, encouraging individual and group action, and inspiring ecologically friendly decisions, the project seeks to promote awareness and motivate progress towards climate action. The anticipated outcomes include fostering knowledgeable supporters of climate action, instilling a sense of group accountability, and driving positive ecological change.
